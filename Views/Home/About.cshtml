                        <h3>The History of Birthdays</h3>

                        <p>
                            Birthdays started around 3,000 years before the common era,
                            conceptualised by our good old friends the Egyptians.
                            But not necessarily in the sense that we celebrate them today.
                            Despite the clues in the name, you know, birth-day, day of birth,
                            this isn’t what the Egyptians actually celebrated. When you boil it back down to the
                            origins of birthdays, they were actually celebrating the birth of someone as a god.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “What’s that?” I hear you ask. What is birthday-becoming-god-celebration and
                            what does it have to do with the Egyptians? Well, when pharaohs were crowned,
                            it was considered that they had become a god. For them, and to be fair, anyone,
                            the day man becomes a god is waaaaay up there above being actually, physically born.

                        <h3>The History of Gift Giving and the Origins of Birthday Gifts</h3>
                    </div>

                        <p>
                            The Romans were among the first people to celebrate birthdays as we know them.
                            That being, they are probably the most succinct answer to “Why do we celebrate birthdays?”.
                            The Romans were the first to celebrate the birth of the common man.
                            They did this with lavish parties where they would shower the birthday boy with gifts,
                            thus starting the history of birthday presents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, though, it was a very much literal interpretation.
                            The common man. That’s right, I couldn’t have experienced these birthday
                            celebrations, alas, I would have to wait until around the 12th Century to
                            take part – some eleven-hundred-and-something years later.
